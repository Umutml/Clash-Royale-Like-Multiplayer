Low Poly Medieval Castle Pack
Pack Creator: Ventuar
v1.1.2
------------------------------------------------
To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

*******
Due to pivot point and import changes in v1.05 and beyond, objects may be shifted out of their previous positions when updating from older
versions. These changes may likely require manual adjustment by the developer to use as they were previously.
*******

Tip: 
To achieve intended graphical results in the demo, switch Color Space (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings) from Gamma 
to Linear, and adjust Shadow Distance (Edit > Project Settings > Quality) to 200-300, and adjust Pixel Light Count (Edit > Project Settings > 
Quality) to 15-20.

Note:
Package made and assembled using Unity's built-in render pipeline. Materials require conversion when importing into URP (Edit > Render Pipeline > 
Universal Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials) and HDRP (Edit > Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to High 
Definition Materials). Lighting/post-processing may require rebuilding for example scenes in URP/HDRP. Media images and screenshots were built and 
rendered in the built-in render pipeline using Unity's Post Processing Stack v2 and linear colorspace. Skyboxes in the trailer courtesy of ProAssets:
